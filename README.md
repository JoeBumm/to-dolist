# To Do list app. Nativly in python

This is a project, that i have no idea how to build. But i'm so excited to try and exiperment with this. I have been programming in python on my college introductory course. I guess this will be very challenging trying out how to implement the skills i have learned in real life projects.

This project algins with my ultimate goal, which is to build productivity tools that serves the society. I want my work to reach and influence millions. At the time of 3/16/2024 I have no idea how to do this **But I will do It**

## Functionality:

### Add Task:
- Implement the `add_task` function to allow users to add tasks to the list.
- Prompt the user to enter a task and append it to the tasks list.
- Ensure the task is saved to a file for persistence.

### View Tasks:
- Implement the `view_tasks` function to display the current list of tasks.
- Iterate through the tasks list and print each task with a corresponding index.

### File Handling:
- Create a text file (e.g., `tasks.txt`) to store the tasks.
- Implement the `save_tasks` function to write tasks to the file.
- Load tasks from the file when the program starts to populate the tasks list.

## Menu and User Input Handling:
- Create a main program loop to display menu options and handle user input.
- Present users with options to add tasks, view tasks, and exit the application.
- Validate user input and handle errors gracefully.

## Integration and Testing:
- Integrate all functions and components to ensure they work together seamlessly.
- Test the application by adding tasks, viewing tasks, and verifying data persistence.
- Make any necessary adjustments or improvements based on testing results.

## Enhancements and Additional Features:
- Consider adding features like marking tasks as completed, updating task details, or deleting tasks.
- Implement more advanced functionalities to enhance the user experience and make the application more robust.
